A general-purpose programming language, focused on simplicity, safety and stability.

> **NOTE:** Rivet is still in the development phase.

Rivet's goal is to be a very powerful programming language and at the same time easy
to use, with a syntax inspired mainly by Rust and C# (which are the coolest languages
I've ever seen), and by other languages such as Python, Lua, TypeScript, etc.

## Features

* **Easy-to-learn syntax**: A syntax without overload of unnecessary elements.
* **Easy error handling**: Via result types: `fn alloc() !`.
* **Named and optional arguments**: Very useful.
* **Struct inheritance and polymorphism**: Traits and Tagged Unions are also supported.
* **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rivet has a very simplified version of Rust's
Ownership and Borrowing system. The lifetimes are inferred by the compiler.

## Run the compiler

> **NOTE:** To run the compiler you must have Python 3.

Just execute `python3 rivetc.py`.
